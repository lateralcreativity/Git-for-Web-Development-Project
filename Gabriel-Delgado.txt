    37. Walk me through Lambda's git flow. 
    First you must always create your own repo by forking what you will work on.
    Second we add our TL as a collaborator.
    Third clone your forked repo onto your system. Ex. git clone <link-to-repo>
    Fourth cd into your clone otherwise you will create a branch in the wrong folder.
    Fifth create a branch using your name. Ex. git checkout -b 'Gabriel-Delgado'

    After you have made changes and want to update your fork you follow these steps.
    First you MUST type (git add .) this will get your changes ready.
    Second we do (git commit -m "Message here") this allows us to attach a message for future reference and to let other people know what we changed.
    Third we do (git push -u origin branch-name) this sends our local changes to the repo.

    After this we go to our repo on github and select our branch so we can do a pull request.
    Before we do anything else we MUST change our base repository to our own repo.
    Finally we add our TL under Reviewers, submit the pull request and wait for our TL to merge it.

Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

    Inline elements only stretch as far as whats in them and they also do not begin on new lines if there are multiples of them, instead they will stack next to each other until there is no more width space.

    Block elements will take up the entire width of the parent container. Ex. We have a header that has a large font and a paragraph element that is a child of it. The paragraph element will stretch all the way to the end of the header leaving a big gap even if the paragraph was only one word. They also begin on new lines if there are multiples of them.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 
    No space is created for the element in the page layout.
    
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 
    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them?
